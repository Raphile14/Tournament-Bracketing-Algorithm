# Tournament-Bracketing-Algorithm
A Final Project for CS124: Algorithms And Complexity.

## Goals
### Primary Goals:
* Create an algorithm that generates tournament brackets
    * Single Eliminations    
    * Round Robin

### Secondary Goals (after primary requirements):
* Input data from a csv
* Create a functional website
* Store data in a database for long term use
* Tournament progressions
* Double Eliminations
